  title: Results API
  version: '1.3.0'
  description: |-
    This API defines the Results api where the LA can share Results with the LMS and SIS. This API is applicable to Assessments (and not Learning Materials), including tests, assignments and exams. The Results of these Assessments will be administered in a gradebook or are presented on dashboards with Results to Teachers or Mentors.
    
    Currently, a single Result type is defined. This Result type contains of a single grade for a summative assessment. In the future the API can be extended with Result types for other (Formative) Assessments. The Result exchange is triggered by a Teacher in the Assessment Platform of the LA. The Result Event should be send near real time to the SIS. The SIS can process the incoming Event and show it to the same Teacher. The Teacher can store the Result in the correct column of the gradebook.

    ## Events
    Events generated by the Results API are :
     - `la.simpleresult` - sent from the LA to the SIS or LMS preferably near realtime.

    ## Scopes
    - `la.result` - scope needed to send results events from la to lms
    
    ## Consent
    Consent is required from the School to receive SimpleResult Events as a SIS or LMS.
