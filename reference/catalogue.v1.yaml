  title: Catalogue API
  version: '1.0'
  description: |-
    This API enables a learning application provider (or anyone who wants to sell products in a Marketplace) to provide information about their products to a Marketplace.

    It is envisaged that the service implementing this API, also implements the generic [Events](https://stichtingsem.stoplight.io/docs/sem-technology-prototype/reference/events.v1.yaml) and [Webhooks](https://stichtingsem.stoplight.io/docs/sem-technology-prototype/reference/webhooks.v1.yaml) API to enable subscription to changes vs polling.

    ## Scopes and Data

    It is envisaged that when a connection is made between a Marketplace and a Learning Application, that the API Key then provided is connected to that specific marketplace. 

    This connection ensures that the Learning Application can provide information that may be specific to commercial agreements with a specific marketplace (e.g. pricing information).

    This specification provides the placeholders for this information to be exchanged, but has no restriction on what is agreed between parties offline.
