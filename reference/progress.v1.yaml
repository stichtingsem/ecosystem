  title: Progress API
  version: '1.0'
  description: |-
    This API defines progress about the specific activities (assignable Units) is the course to report to the LMS. Main goal is to inform teachers on progress (which activities are completed) and possible indication that the activity was completed, but needs attention of the teacher. 

    Progress is reported on the actities of the LA (based on the UA (assignable units) in the course description.
    Progress is reported when an activity is started or completed, not while the activity is in progress. If the activity is adaptive and will take more time for one student due to addaptive levels, that is not reported.

    Activities have a life cylcle of not-started, started, completed. The not started is the deafult and will not be reported, unless (for some reason) the status goes back to not-started. The abandoned state is to indicate that the activity was started,but will never be completed (optional)

    The API does not force the LA to use a standard for the indication about the quality of the progress. That is optional and is intended to give the LA a way to tell the teacher that the progress was not standard and the teacher is advised to have a look at the LA's dashboard (with a direct url). An LA can provide any scale (1-10, avarage, good, bad) by adding this as text. The LMS should not try to combine these indications for a complete chapter or paragraph.

    Normally this progress is send as events. When the consent flow is completed and both LA and LMS have consent the events are send. 

    At this moment there is no catchup mechanism defined. (we still have discussion if there should be an API to retrieve the progress. we tend to say no..)

    In the progress statement the LA can add the entitlement and course information so the LMS can use that information to efficiently process the events.

    ### Events
    SimpleProgress - send from the LA to the LMS prefereably near realtime so the LMS can show progress for teachers.

    ## Scopes and Data

    - la.progress - scope needed to send events from la to lms
