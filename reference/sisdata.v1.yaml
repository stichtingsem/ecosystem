  title: Student Information System API
  version: '1.0'
  description: |
    This is an API provided by the SIS in the SEM ecosystem, and is designed to enable a SIS to make the core information about teachers, learners, subjects and groups available to the rest of the ecosystem in a security and privacy cocnious way.

    # Events

    It is envisaged that the service implementing this API, also implements the generic [Events](https://stichtingsem.stoplight.io/docs/sem-technology-prototype/reference/events.v1.yaml) and [Webhooks](https://stichtingsem.stoplight.io/docs/sem-technology-prototype/reference/webhooks.v1.yaml) API to enable subscription to changes vs polling.

    Events generated by the SIS API are connected to state changes for key entities:

     - `sis.student` - A student has been created or modified   
     - `sis.student-delivery` - A students delivery information has been created or modified     
     - `sis.teacher` - A teacher has been created or modified
     - `sis.group` - A group has been modified (this is an aggregate event) - this means that basic metadata changed, a student added/removed, a teacher added or removed or a student subject choice modified within a group.     
     
    Events about students, teachers and groups is scoped per schoolyear. Each year a new set of events is generated. A recieving system (LMS/LA/MP) should check if the events are for the current year or already for the next year.

    # Privacy and Scopes
     
    Data from the SIS can be sensitive, and the events and APIs available to a requesting service depend on the scopes requested and approved during setup.  The following scopes exist for the SIS, and map to the following entities and attributes:

    `sis.student-teacher-group`

    This scope enables a requestor to get basic information about a user (student or teacher) to enable that platform to present appropriate information or a basic profile for them and understand what groups or subjects they are enrolled in or teach.

    ### Event Access

    |Events|Event Data|Rationale|
    |------|---------|----|
    |sis.student|id, eckId, name, school, groups, subjects|To enable the requesting service to maintain a copy of basic (non-PII) student profile information|
    |sis.teacher|id, eckId, name, school, groups|To enable the requesting service to maintain a copy of basic (non-PII) teacher information|
    |sis.group|id, name, school, students, teachers, and subjectchoices|To enable the requesting service to maintain a copy group information|

    ### Data Visibility

    |Entity|Fields|Rationale|
    |------|---------|-----|
    |Student|id, eckId, name, school, groups, subjects|To enable the requesting service to maintain a copy of basic (non-PII) student profile information|
    |Teacher|id, eckId, name, school, groups|To enable the requesting service to maintain a copy of basic (non-PII) teacher information|

    `sis.student-teacher-delivery`

    This scope enables a requestor to get additional information required to support the physical delivery of books or other material directly to an individual.  This exchange includes PII, and would be requested in addition the basic `sis.student-teacher-group` scope, so the following should be read as additive to that scope.

    We have a principle to never send PII in events or store in an event log, so this event is only a notification.  The subscribing system must call back to retrieve the information.
     

    ### Event Access

    |Events|Event Data|Rationale|
    |------|---------|---|
    |sis.student-delivery|id, eckId|This is a notification only, as there should be no PII sent in events - only accessed by API calls.|

    ### Data Visibility

    |Entity|Fields|Rationale|
    |------|---------|-----|
    |Student Delivery|dateOfBirth, emailAddress, postcode, houseNumber, firstname, surname, tussenvoegsel|To enable the requesting service to maintain a copy of contact and delivery information|
