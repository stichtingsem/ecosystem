  title: Entitlement API
  version: '1.0'
  description: |
    This is an API that handles the comunication of entitlements between MP, LA and LMS.

    The Entitlements are the core of the SEM ecosystem and are created in the MP as a result of a school selecting learning material for the students. The MP creates entilements and send these to the LA to make sure students have access to the material. The entitlements are also send to the LMS so the LMS can create url/links for each student to the website of the LA.

    Most of the API is synchronious as it is important that all parties share exactly the same view of the entielements. The MP is in control, the LA will report when an entitlement is activated and became a license. Both LMS and LA can request the latest status of the entitlements by the MP.

    Actual usage of an entitlement can be requested via the Usage API.

    This API is implemented by MP, LA and LMS, but not all parties will implement the same endpoints. 

    Endpoint | provider | client | remark
    -- | --- | --- | -----
    POST /entitlements | LA, LMS | MP | Send new entitlements 
    POST /entitlements/changestatus | LA, LMS | MP | Change the status of an entitlement
    POST /entitlements/changelicenseestatus | LA, LMS | MP |change status for a specific entilee/licensee
    POST /entitlements/firstactivation | MP | LA | Send activation per student
    GET /entitlements | MP | LA, LMS | get entilement to check status
    GET /entitlements/school | MP | LA, LMS | get entilements per school to check status

    When a request is send to an endpoint this party does not provide : a 405 Method not allowed should be returned

    ## Events
    The Entitlements APi will not use the event mechanisme. The requests need to be handled synchroniously, so the requesting party known that the entitlements and changes to the entitlements are checked and processed immediatelly.

    ## Scopes
     
    Data from in the entitlements can be sensitive, and the APIs available to a requesting service depend on the scopes requested and approved during setup.  The following scopes exist for the Entitlements, and map to the following entities and attributes:

    `mp.entitlement` - scope that allows MP to send entitlements and updates, allows LA,LMS to retrieve entitlements
    `la.entitlement.activation` - scope that allows a LA to send first activation

        This call is used to change the status of one individual licensee within an entitlement. When an entitle activates the entitlement for the first time the status for this entitlee is activated. after that moment the MP can use this call to change the status to cancelled or blocked (or back to active).
