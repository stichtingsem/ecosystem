# SIS Provider

A SIS is a management information system for education establishments to manage core student data. Student information systems provide core capabilities for registering teachers and students in the school, attaching them to classes and groups, and providing that data to other services.  This system is typically heavily integrated with, or offered as a bundle with, an [LMS](../services/lms.md).  This system is the source of the ECK-ID.

TODO:  This was the blend of a SIS and LMS in the definition used in these documents.  We need to review the split.
