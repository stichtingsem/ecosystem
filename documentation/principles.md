## Principles of the SEM ecosystem: 10 times better

The SEM ecosystem solves the challenges of the current learning materials chain and improves the supply and access of learning materials on ten goals.

| # | Goals | Current | Proposed solution | Beneficiary |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Immediate Access to digital material | - Current system does not allow immediate access. In most cases access is dependent on upfront payment and/or the physical delivery of folio components (in case of hybrid products) | - Immediate access for users is guaranteed by entitlements (on the highest possible level such as a school)<br>    - No direct relations with stock levels and availability folio component<br>    - Schools control access through the LMS. Data is directly shared with connected partners (MP)<br>    - Possible access issues are dealt with in front  | Pupil/Student,Teachers, School boards, LMC, MP, LA |
| 2 | Dynamic Learning | - In the current system materials are bought for a schoolyear based on a LML compiled before the start of the school year. This is a static process<br>- Schools are typically connected to and dependent on specific partners | - Ecosystem enables dynamics learning<br>    - Learning material can be bought based on LML, but also on the wider catalogue presented in the LMS<br>    - Teachers can promote learning material in the LMS for immediate access<br>    - Entitle on group and/or individual level<br>    - Technical solution is flexible and can be used to support all kinds (not only ECK material)<br>    - Schools can be connected to multiple marketplaces and  LMS’s at the same time | Pupil/Student, Teacher, LMC, School Boards |
| 3 | Easy setup | - Schools are not in control due to un transparency of the system and the data transported between partners | - IT administrators can do setups themselves instead of hiring brokers and other IT company’s<br>    - Setup connections from LMS to marketplace and learning applications will be easy to achieve like for example the configuration of Office 365 accounts<br>    - Schools at at all times in control due to increased transparency | IT Administrator (Schools), LMC, SIS |
| 4 | Various business models | - The current system only supports business models based on transaction | - The ecosystem supports business models based on payment (transaction) or usage (subscription).<br>    - Examples: Subscription, Pre-paid, Post-paid, Free content, Freemium, etc. | LA, MP, School boards |
| 5 | Low threshold | - Current system is too complex for new partners to enter | - The new ecosystem is easy to enter for new partners because of its low complexity<br>    - Less, transparent, discoverable services based on role(s)<br>    - Technical solution is well documented | LMS, MP, LA |
| 6 | Increase trust | - Limited actual information available<br>- Untransparent processes<br>- Mistrust between chain partners | - Schools and connected partners have more and actual informationin the ecosystem<br>    - Information will be shared immediately on predefined events<br>    - Support will be easier because of the available information | MP. LA, School Boards |
| 7 | Transparent transactions and balanced administrations | - Untransparency: due to the complexity of the chain there are often disagreements (# licenses sold, # license stock) | - In the new ecosystem administration follows usage, but balanced administrations are ensured<br>    - Market places establish entitlements at learning applications based on SIS/LMS data<br>    - Entitlements are available for involved partners and are the base for valid transactions | LMC, LMS, MP, LA, School Boards |
| 8 | Less central services | - Strong dependency on central services (Edu iX) and Lika’s | - Limited dependencies to central services<br>    - Connections are setup directly between partners in the ecosystem (decentral services) | SIS, LMS, ITAdministrator (School) |
| 9 | Compliance (security & privacy) | - Although attempts have been made and will be made to minimalize data this will remain difficult in the current chain due to the complexity | - The ecosystem ensures data minimisation<br>    - Transactions take place on identifiers for products, schools, users, market place<br>- School (IT administrator) manage the access and right to data in the SIS/LMS<br>    - Data is shared based on role (target binding).<br>    - Personal data will only be shared after additional authentication | All |
| 10 | Futureproof technical solution | - The currently used technical standards like SAML and SOAP  are end of life cycle  | - The technical solution is based on modern and mature coding standards(events, webhooks, Oauth) | All |
