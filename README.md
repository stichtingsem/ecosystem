## Moving from a chain to an ecosystem

Short summary of the scope and reason for this standard.

## Enable data exchange in the supply and usage flow of learning materials

A typical school uses a broad range of learning materials from several educational publishers or platform suppliers. The SEM Ecosystem sets a standard for the exchange of data between all parties that play a key role in the use of (digital) learning materials within schools.

The SEM Ecosystem focuses on the minimal set of data required for:

1. Supply of learning materials including the activities:

	- Inform
	- Order
	- Deliver
	- Evaluate

2. Usage of learning materials including the activities:

	- Authorize
	- Use
	- Report progress and result
	- Monitor
