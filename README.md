Short summary of the scope and reason for this standard.

## Enable data exchange in the supply and usage flow of learning materials

A typical school uses a broad range of learning materials from several educational publishers or platform suppliers. The SEM Ecosystem sets a standard for the exchange of data between all parties that play a key role in the use of (digital) learning materials within schools.

	a. Inform
	b. Order
	c. Deliver
	d. Evaluate
2. Usage of learning materials including the activities:
	a. Authorize
	b. Use
	c. Report progress and result
	d. Monitor
