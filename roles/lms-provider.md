# LMS Provider

An LMS is a management information system for education establishments to manage course scheduling for teachers and students. An LMS provides capabilities for registering students in courses; documenting grading, transcripts, results of student tests and other assessment scores; building student schedules and tracking student attendance.

This is the blend of a [SIS Provider](sis-provider.md) and the [Learning Management Provider](learning-management-provider.md) in the definition used in these documents.
