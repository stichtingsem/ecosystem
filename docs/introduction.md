# Introduction
A typical school uses a broad range of learning materials from several educational publishers or educational platform suppliers. The SEM Ecosystem sets a standard for the exchange of data between all parties that play a key role in the order and access of these (digital) learning materials within schools. Parties involved are amongst others providers of student information systems, learning managemenst systems, distribution and fulfillment, and (digital) learning materials.

## Structure of this repository

This repository consists of the following elements:
- [Big Picture](big-picture.md) which explains all the concepts within the ecosystem in more detail.
- [Technical reference](technical-reference.md) with information about the architecture, used standards and links to the reference files.
- [API documentation](https://stichtingsem.stoplight.io/docs/ecosystem) can be found on stoplight.
- [Implementation Guide](documentation/implementation-guide.md) with practical advice for new parties.
- [Glossary](glossary.md) describing all terms and definitions used within the ecosystem.
- [SEM Party directory](SEM-Party-Directory.md) with all Parties that are currently active in the ecosystem.

This repository is an initiative of the Stichting Samenwerkende Educatieve Marktpartijen (SEM) and is based upon the [principles](principles.md) defined in the working document [Moving from a chain to an ecosystem](documentation/documents/).
