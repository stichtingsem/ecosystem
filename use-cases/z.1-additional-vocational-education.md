# Appendix A â€“ Additional requirements Vocational Education

TODO:  This needs to be reviewed and incorporated into the use cases.

Just to keep in mind some of the differences that exists between Secondary Education and Vocational Education.

-	Most (not all) licenses are ordered per person, not in bulk
-	Licenses payment is done individually
    -	But the person who pays may differ from the user (in case of an individual buy that is also true for secondary education)
-	Schools are required (by law) to pay for exam-licenses for their students so schools do order licenses
-	Products are ordered throughout the year with peaks in August and February and are expected to be delivered in 24 hours
-	There is no real school season anymore like secondary education, so licenses commonly do not have a set start and end date, they just have a license duration for a number of days or for a cohort.
    -	Licenses can be valid throughout summer vacation.
-	Schools can be a lot bigger in number of students
-	There are returning student to a school: they take a course, and are absent for months (even years) and return to the school for the same or a new course
-	There is a big variety in LML, there are hundreds per school and sometimes multiple per course.
-	It is common that other items than books and licenses are on a LML, for example tools and work gear.
-	Students switching schools is more common
    d-	Because the students own the licenses, they want to use their license in the new school or buy a new license and use their previous results/work. So licenses and results are sometimes moved to a new account.
