# Diagrams

[Edit via Diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/?mode=github#Hstichtingsem%2Ffunctional-overview%2Fmaster%2Fdiagrams%2Fprocess-diagrams.drawio)

The images in this folder are exported as SVF files from the diagram.net file.  To update them, you need to manually 'Export -> SVG' and then update the file in this folder.  Please do not rename the files as they are referenced in other files.

To add new images, simply add a tab to the main document, and then export.  If needed we can add more overall drawing files if it gets too cluttered.
